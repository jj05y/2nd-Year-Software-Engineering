This was used as a shared workspace for the MVP team (myself, uncheckedshrimp and CooliestGerard) to build our scrabble game.

/MVPScrabble contrains our version of the game

/CompCode contains a version of the game written by our lecturer, for which we wrote a bot which could be played against others.
/FastRobotScrabble contains a fast bot
/RobotScrabble contains a slightly slower, but more comprehensive bot
