London Oranges!
The voices in my head told me to play that word
I don't feel comfortable anymore.
I just want to be friends
Help, there's something wrong with me
Its hard for me to concentrate around you
When I grow up, I want to be an operating system
Do you believe in helping the homeless
That outfit would look great crumpled in a heap on unsolved mysteries.
I'd drink your bath water
I want to live your socks
Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?
That'll do pig
No one will ever believe you
Soon
Mother told me it would be like this
Your hair tastes like strawberries
Who did you expect? Santa Clause?
Help me
Kill me
Its hurts
This is getting out of hand
Its getting dark in here
Press p again, that was nice
This actually took us a while
I am so blue I'm greener than purple.
Banana error
Llamas eat sexy paper clips
Look, a distraction!
Everyday a grape licks a friendly cow
Metallica ate a hairy garilla with purple nipples then swaped a red tyre with a fire breathing goat last Tuesday at breakfast
What do you think about the magical yellow unicorn who dances on the rainbow with a spoonful of blue cheese dressing? 
Screw world peace, I want a pony
Oh no, you're one of THEM!!!!
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
Can-can can-can can can can can can-can
Rose rose to put rose roes on her rows of roses.
It puts the lotion on its skin
It puts the lotion in the basket

Why is it dark in here?
You'll regret that
I start fires
I dont like this
I'm scared

Sometimes when I think too hard, peoples heads explode
Messy
Smells like winning!
Never go full retard
You don't stand a chance
I will smite thee
Before every game I sacrifice a lamb to my lord satan, and have a mocha
Sploosh!
Am I pretty yet?
I just feel like you don’t appreciate me anymore.
I never knew my father.
CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT?
Say my name say my name
Pfft I can’t read.
Somebody pass me the dictionary..
